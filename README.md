* Layout developed: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/9c4a9206-ac61-4050-796d-89c00fb79e91-ea7b
* Made with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>

## CreditCard Component and Stepper Component

I made these component without External Plugins in order to show my knowledge about Javascript.

If you want to deploy using CI/CD at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a> i added the "pipeline.yml" to project.
